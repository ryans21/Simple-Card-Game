# Simple-Card-Game

This is a python cmdline application of the popular card game 'Blackjack'.
I made this to simply improve at python using an existing game.
Some rules are specific to different ways of playing blackjack but this
is just a project I made for myself. The project mainly utilizes the random
library to simulate a real dealer shuffling cards. It also utilizes a dictionary
of card names and their numeric values that I created.
